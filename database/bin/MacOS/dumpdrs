# Take 1:   triggers were fully qualified: fix was to update their DDL in the db
# Take 2:   Triggers in DDLFile were defined before tables they were to go with
#           Along the way, I noticed that the data file also referenced the tables before they were defined.
#           That's mostly ok, but I took out --no-create-info in the DDL definition
