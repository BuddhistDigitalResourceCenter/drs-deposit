# Documentation

## Overview
This directory contains BDRC and HUL documents. All new documents should fall into the categories that the sub-folders represent.

Therefore, if you add material directly to this directory, please do it in a separate branch and issue a pull request. This allows us to review and move it to the appropriate directory.

## The directories
### BDRC Design
This folder contains all design documents originating here at BDRC. It should only contain designs for code: project plans and formal documents go elsewhere.
### DRS2
Harvard's official DRS Documentation. Obsolete, and mostly replaced by

1. [Harvard DRS Documentation](https://library.harvard.edu/lts/systems/drs)

and
2. [DRS User Documentation Center](https://wiki.harvard.edu/confluence/display/LibraryStaffDoc/DRS+User+Documentation+Center)

### HULDocs
These are documents of record that HUL originated.
### ProjectPlans
Harvard and BDRC project ProjectPlans
### ReferenceMaterial
This folder contains documents which BDRC will upload to DRS as part of a deposit.
