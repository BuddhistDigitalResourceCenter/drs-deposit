Yup, that was it – I’m in. (using the telnet port 22) was what threw me.


Thanks,  much

Jim,
One more thing, I noticed after looking at the screenshots you provided: right now BDRC only has the 
DRS2 QA drop box credentials, so you should be only able to connect to drs2drop-qa.hul.harvard.edu. 
Make sure you set the connection to SFTP, port 22.

Jim,
Make sure you are using the VPN tunnel #hul when you connect. 
In the VPN login name field the you should put in:
jimk@tbrc.org#hul
 
Then, once you are connected to the #hul tunnel, try to access the DRS2 QA dropbox again.
Let me know how it goes.

HI Vitaly,
Thank you for establishing my VPN id. I’ve installed the Cisco software, it’s up on a couple of clients.
 
However,….
 
On https://wiki.harvard.edu/confluence/display/LibraryStaffDoc/DRS+Quick+Start+Reference
The production and QA DRS2 dropboxes are given as 
DRS 2 Production Dropboxes
*	 
*	Host Name: drs2drop.lib.harvard.edu
*	…
DRS 2 QA (Test) Dropboxes
*	 
*	Host Name: drs2drop-qa.hul.harvard.edu
*	…
Yet when I try to access them from Filezilla from in the firewall (as jimk@tbrc.org, with my Harvard 
password, or with the older drc2_tbrctest id, the results are always the same as in the screen shot (I 
think it’s an id issue, because when I log on with a random email and password, the response is the 
same as below.)
Also, my HUID is not authorized to use drs webadmin. Would you be the person to correct that, or 
should I enter a ticket?
 
Thanks, 
jim
